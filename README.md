"Gap" chat system

Gap is a practical chat system which can help you to understand
network programming basics, client/server model, etc
by looking source code and make your changes and see what happens!

If you make a new feature or an improvement, you can share it with
others. Also if you were interested, you can learn how to use
source control systems (e.g. git) to do so.

To get started:

1- Download whole project by clicking "Download ZIP"
	or browse other versions (if latest version is buggy) and get which one is appropriate for you.
	review full history of project at:
	https://github.com/hakan648/gap/commits/master
	
2- Browse to Project folder and run Gap.sln

3- Compile whole solution.

4- To run project, browse to Debug/Bin folder of each project
	and run executable files wich named as project.
	
	\Project\Gap.Server\bin\Debug\Gap.Server.exe
	\Project\Gap.Win\bin\Debug\Gap.Win.exe
